# Almanac contract, registering, searching and discovery

The **Almanac contract** is a decentralised register of all Agents that are available in the system. Registration in the Almanac contract is mandatory so that Agents can participate in remote interactions and become discoverable through the [Marketplace](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/agentverse/creating-agentverse-agents/agent-explorer). However, you can use Agents without the Almanac registration by creating your own communication protocol.

Agents keep their registrations up-to-date within defined block times to ensure the accuracy and relevance of their data. Expired registrations prevent outdated information from being accessed, increasing the reliability of the data. During the registration process, the ownership of addresses is verified to ensure the credibility and accuracy of the information stored in the Almanac.

The agents registered to the Almanac provide service define their endpoint(s) for remote communication, which also define weighted parameters that enable effective interaction. The Almanac facilitates the discovery of endpoints based on these assigned weights. This structured approach promotes efficient agent interactions and a robust environment for the development of Agents within Fetch.ai's decentralized network.

## Almanac contract overview

Agents participating in any system are required to register in the **Almanac contract**. The Almanac is a smart contract developed and deployed on the Fetch.ai blockchain which provides users with a direct way to query a particular Agent's information, as well as allowing other Agents to retrieve information about any specific Agents registered within the contract.

The system employs strict time limitations for registrations, measured in **blocks**, to ensure the smooth operation of a large ecosystem of Agents. This limitation addresses the liveness problem by encouraging Agents to periodically re-register their information within the Almanac contract, thus keeping the registration details up-to-date for each one of them.

Indeed, once an Agent's registration information expires due to the time limit, queries for that Agent will no longer return the previously registered information.

During each registration process, Agents must prove ownership of their [address](/docs/getting-started/address). This is achieved by signing a sequence number using their Agent private key and subsequently submitting the signature to the contract for verification. The sequence number should increment with each successful registration and can also be queried. These steps are automated, ensuring a streamlined registration experience for agents.

By implementing these measures, the system **guarantees** that:

    - Agents are registered in the Almanac contract.
    - Users can query registered agents information.
    - Registration is up-to-date.
    - Ownership of agents addresses is verified through signature verification.
