# Introduction

This API Reference describes the RESTful and streaming interfaces of the platform.

## Open AI Compatibility

Where possible we have made every effort to conform to the OpenAI API specification. This largely means that users can simply plug the new API.

## Authorization

API keys can be created from your account when you log into ASI1. Authorization is done by adding the following header into your requests:

`Authorization: Bearer <api token>`

**Remember your API key is a secret, do not give it to anyone!** 

If you need to remove access for a particular key simply log into your account and delete is from your profile.
